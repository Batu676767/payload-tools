## [Author Info plugin](./src/index.ts)

Take the guesswork out of tracking **who created, edited, and published content** across your **collections and globals**â€”**automatically**.  

ðŸ”¹ **Seamless Author Tracking** â€“ This plugin **automatically captures and stores** key authoring details, so you always know **who created, modified, and published** each document.  
ðŸ”¹ **Enhanced Metadata** â€“ While Payload CMS tracks creation and modification dates, it **doesnâ€™t store publication dates**â€”but this plugin does! Now, youâ€™ll have a clear **record of the most recent publish date** for every entry.  
ðŸ”¹ **Integrated Author Data** â€“ A new **"Author Data" tab** is added to the authoring interface, providing a centralized place for all user activity related to the document.  

With this **fully automated** tracking system, you'll always have complete visibility into **who did what and when**â€”**without any extra effort**.
